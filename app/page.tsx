          <p>Hey, nice to meet you!! I'm Joss üòÅ</p>
          <p>
            As a
            ‚ú®writer-software-developer-community-builder-systems-design-engineer‚ú®,
            most of my brainpower is spent thinking about how we can design and
            iterate on social, economic, digital, and physical systems to help
            humans (individually AND collectively) live our best lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the next four months, I'll be working on my own projects (stay
            tuned!), but am always open to chat about big ideas and
            opportunities related to community building, startups, walkable
            cities/urbanism, software/tech, and economics and incentives. We
            will be great friends if you're kind, nerdy, and ambitious üòÅ (in
            that order!).
          </p>
          <p>
            MAJOR bonus points if you have a track record of creating
            opportunities for the people around you and understand how important
            it is to centre inclusion and diverse representation in everything
            you do.
          </p>
          <p>Talk soon!</p>
          <p> Joss</p>
