      <p>Hey, nice to meet you!! I'm Joss üòÅ</p>
      <p>
        As a
        ‚ú®writer-software-developer-community-builder-systems-design-engineer‚ú®,
        most of my brainpower is spent thinking about how we can design and
        iterate on social, economic, digital, and physical systems to help
        humans (individually AND collectively) live our best lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the next four months, I'll be working on my own projects (stay
        tuned!), but am always open to chat about big ideas and opportunities
        related to community building, startups, walkable cities/urbanism,
        software/tech, and economics and incentives. We will be great friends if
        you're kind, nerdy, and ambitious üòÅ (in that order!).
      </p>
      <p>
        MAJOR bonus points if you have a track record of creating opportunities
        for the people around you and understand how important it is to centre
        inclusion and diverse representation in everything you do.
      </p>
      <p>Talk soon!</p>
      <p> Joss</p>
